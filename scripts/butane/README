Conversation
------------

The Conversation class is intended to be used as a context manager for dialog
interactions. A Conversation manages a single topic which should be loaded the
conventional way - a floating dialog box :-D.

- Active Conversation :: Only 1 "conversation" can be active (instantiated) at a time.

  - stop :: stop the active Conversation. Call this in onUnload. Static Method.

  - ask :: Ask the user for a single response (via $yield= in qichat) by going
    to "tag" in the conversation topic. listening is handled
    automatically. Block until $yield is raised. Return the response as a
    str. If stop is called while we're blocking we __exit__ the conversation.

  - polar :: (ask variant) Ask a yes / no question. Return the response as a
    bool. Yield 1, yes, y / 0, no, n for True / False respectively.

  - wait :: (ask variant) Ask a question and wait for a response. We don't care
    about the response, we just block until there is one.

  - say :: Go to "tag" in the active topic. Block until we're done saying the
    text.

- @linked :: Decorated function will be a callback to $exec

- unlink :: Destroy all @linked callbacks. Call this in onUnload.
